# 🚗 Car Price Prediction Project

This project is a **Machine Learning-based application** that predicts the price of a car based on its features.  
It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and a **Streamlit web app** for interactive predictions.

---

## **Project Overview**

Car prices vary based on multiple factors such as engine size, horsepower, car dimensions, fuel type, and many other features.  
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict car prices given these features.

---

## **Dataset**

- The dataset used in this project contains various car attributes such as:
  - `CarName`, `fueltype`, `aspiration`, `doornumber`, `carbody`, `drivewheel`, `enginelocation`  
  - `wheelbase`, `carlength`, `carwidth`, `curbweight`, `enginesize`, `horsepower`, `peakrpm`, `citympg`, `highwaympg`, `price`
